Sure! Here's an example of a README file for your Weather App project on GitHub:

# Weather App

The Weather App is an Android application that allows users to search for weather information of a specific city and view the current weather conditions. It is developed using Kotlin programming language and Android Jetpack components.

## Features

- Search for weather information of any city.
- View the current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.
- Display an image representing the weather condition.
- Utilizes the free version of a weather API for retrieving weather data (with a limit of 100 API requests per month).

## Getting Started

To run the Weather App locally or make modifications to the codebase, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/GaneshParmar/WeatherApp.git`
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

## Libraries Used

The Weather App utilizes the following libraries:

- Retrofit2: For making network requests and handling API communication.
- Gson: For parsing JSON responses from the weather API.
- Glide: For efficient image loading and caching.
- Android Jetpack components: Including View Binding for seamless UI binding.

## API Key

Please note that the app uses a free version of a weather API, which has a monthly limit of 100 API requests. If you plan to use the app extensively or encounter API request limitations, consider obtaining a paid API key and replacing it in the code.
